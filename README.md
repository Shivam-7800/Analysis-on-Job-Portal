# Analysis-on-Job-Portal


In today's digital age, job seekers and recruiters alike are turning
to online job portals to search for employment opportunities or
talent. Job portals act as intermediaries between job seekers and
employers, providing a platform for both to connect with each
other. This presentation will provide an analysis of job portals,
including their features, benefits, and limitations.

**Features of job portals:**

Job portals are typically designed to be user-friendly, with a focus
on helping job seekers find the right job and employers find the
right candidate. Some of the common features of job portals
include:

1. Job search: Users can search for jobs based on their skills,
experience, location, and other criteria.
2. Job alerts: Users can set up job alerts to receive notifications
when new jobs that match their criteria are posted.

*Benefits of job portals:*

Job portals offer several benefits to both job seekers and
employers. Some of the key benefits include:

1. Increased visibility: Job portals give job seekers access to a
wider range of job opportunities, while employers can reach
a larger pool of candidates.

2. Time savings: Job portals streamline the recruitment process,
saving time for both job seekers and employers.

3. Cost savings: Job portals can be a more cost-effective way to
find talent than traditional recruitment methods like print
advertising or job fairs.

**Advantages of EDA:**


1. Identify patterns and trends: EDA helps to identify
patterns and trends in data, which can help to inform
further analysis and decision-making.

2. Understand data distribution: EDA allows us to
understand the distribution of data, including any outliers
or anomalies that may require further investigation.

3. Identify data quality issues: EDA helps to identify data
quality issues, such as missing data, inconsistent values,
and errors, which can be addressed before further analysis.

4. Hypothesis generation: EDA helps to generate
hypotheses about relationships between variables, which
can be tested with further analysis.

5. Communicate findings: EDA can be used to
communicate findings to stakeholders in an easily
digestible and understandable way.



“Overall, EDA is a valuable tool for exploring and summarizing
data, but it should be used in conjunction with other analytical
approaches to gain a complete understanding of the data.”

*NLP has numerous applications, including chatbots and virtual
assistants, sentiment analysis for social media monitoring, voice
recognition for personal assistants, machine translation for
multilingual communication, and text summarization for content
curation.*

*Advantages of Natural Process Language* :

1. Improved communication: NLP can help people
communicate more effectively with computers and other
machines that understand natural language.

2. Automation: NLP can automate many tasks that would
otherwise require human intervention. This can save time and
reduce costs.

3. Sentiment analysis: NLP can be used to analyze the sentiment
of a large volume of text, which can be useful for businesses
looking to gauge public opinion about their products or
services.
4. Translation: NLP can be used to translate text from one
language to another, which can be useful for businesses that
operate in multiple countries.

**Data Visualization through Tableau**

*Chart* :
Once the data have been collected, the crucial problem becomes
learning, whatever we can, from the data. Graph is a powerful tool
of describing the dataset. A large dataset is required to be presented
in graphical form that can capture the structure of underlying data.
A quick glance at the picture elucidates the point easily then does a
page filled with words and numbers. The term charts as a visual
representation of data has multiple meaning.
